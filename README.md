# VOLTAGE-COMPARATOR-USING-OP-AMP
To learn about operational amplifier or op amp , that is designed with certain characteristics (high input resistance, low output resistance, and a large differential gain) that make it a nearly ideal amplifier and useful building-block in many circuit applications. OP AMP is almost like an ideal amplifier.
